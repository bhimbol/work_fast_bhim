        <p>
            Welcome! This site was crafted with passion and powered by Python Django.
            This site is currently in the development stage and will continue to evolve as my skills improve through practice.
            Here's a glimpse into how it came to life:

                <strong>SMS Sending and Receiving:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I implemented an SMS sending and receiving feature for this site using Twilio. However, I haven't found a practical application for it yet.
                        Feel free to test it if you'd like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To test it:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Click "Tools", Click "SMS"  at the top.</li>
                            <li>Send a text message to the displayed number.</li>
                            <li>Your message will be shown on this page after sending.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for sending SMS, I may not have enough balance in my Twilio account, so unfortunately, you can't test it now.
                        It worked when I was developing it using a free account. LoL.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
